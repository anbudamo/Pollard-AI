# Pollard-AI

Pollard Memorial libray is located in the town of Lowell, MA. The library boasts an impressive website with the ability to browse the catalog of books across Massachusetts. Yet when browsing the collection, many searh results lack a summary that a user can read and instantly gauge their interest. That is why Pollard AI was created: to shows users the list of search results along with a generated book summary. The app uses LLM integration to harness the information in the search results, like title and author, and produce the blurb for each of them. 

Using Pollard AI, library users can quickly and conveniently browse the library collection online like they would in real life.
